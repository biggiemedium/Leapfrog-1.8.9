## Overview

Leapfrog Client was developed as my second utility client project, following my initial 1.12.2 version. This educational project was created to deepen my understanding of:

- Client-server architecture in Minecraft
- Bypass techniques for various server protections
- Anticheat detection mechanisms and their inner workings
- Network packet manipulation and analysis

> **Note:** This project has been archived and is shared purely for educational purposes.

## Learning Journey

This client represents the second of three versions I developed:
1. Initial 1.12.2 version (first attempt)
2. **This version** - focused on understanding anticheat and network communication
3. Later refined version with improved architecture

Through creating this client, I gained valuable insights into Java development practices, game modification concepts, and security models in multiplayer environments.
