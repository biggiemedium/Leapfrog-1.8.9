</div>

## Overview

Leapfrog Client was developed as my second utility client project, following my initial 1.12.2 version. This iteration represents my exploration into understanding:

* Client-server architecture
* Bypass techniques
* Anticheat detection mechanisms
* Network packet manipulation

> **Note:** This project has been abandoned and is shared purely for archival and educational purposes.

## Development Journey

This client represents the second of three versions I developed:
1. Initial 1.12.2 version (first attempt)
2. **This version** - focused on understanding anticheat and network communication
3. Later refined version with improved architecture

## Educational Purpose

This repository contains code written during my learning journey. It demonstrates:

* My early approach to Java development
* Understanding of game modification concepts
* Exploration of client-server security models
